In 2009, Dr Dre re-released The Chronic as The Chronic ReLit And From The Vault, a remastered version with seven bonus tracks that were previously unreleased or rare. The bonus tracks include collaborations with CPO, Jewell, Treat, Tyrone, and Amber. The Chronic ReLit And From The Vault also features a DVD with a documentary about the making of the album and music videos for some of the songs. The re-release was intended to celebrate the 17th anniversary of the original album and to build anticipation for Dr Dre's long-awaited third album, Detox.
 
The Chronic ReLit And From The Vault is a must-have for any fan of Dr Dre and hip-hop in general. It showcases Dr Dre's genius as a producer and rapper, as well as the talent and charisma of his collaborators. It also offers a glimpse into the golden era of West Coast rap and the culture that inspired it. The Chronic ReLit And From The Vault is a classic album with bonus tracks that enhance its legacy and appeal.

One of the most anticipated and elusive albums in hip-hop history is Dr Dre's Detox. The album was supposed to be Dr Dre's third and final solo project, following his classic albums The Chronic (1992) and 2001 (1999). Detox was first announced in 2002, and since then, fans have been waiting for more than two decades for its release. However, Detox has been plagued by delays, leaks, cancellations, and false hopes. Dr Dre has repeatedly stated that he was not satisfied with the quality of the material he had recorded, and that he wanted to make sure that Detox would live up to his high standards and expectations. He also claimed that he was busy working on other projects, such as producing albums for Eminem, 50 Cent, Kendrick Lamar, and others, as well as developing his Beats by Dre headphones and streaming service.
 
Over the years, several songs that were allegedly intended for Detox have surfaced online, either as official singles or as unauthorized leaks. Some of these songs include "Kush" featuring Snoop Dogg and Akon, "I Need a Doctor" featuring Eminem and Skylar Grey, "Under Pressure" featuring Jay-Z, "Die Hard" featuring Eminem, "Topless" featuring Nas and T.I., "Mr. Prescription" featuring Eminem and Skylar Grey, and "Syllables" featuring Eminem, Jay-Z, 50 Cent, Stat Quo, and Cashis. These songs gave fans a glimpse of what Detox could sound like, but they also raised more questions about the direction and theme of the album. Some of the songs featured Dr Dre rapping about his legacy, his struggles with fame and addiction, and his motivation to make one last masterpiece. Others featured him collaborating with some of the biggest names in hip-hop, showcasing his versatility and influence as a producer.
 
Despite the hype and anticipation surrounding Detox, Dr Dre eventually decided to scrap the album altogether. In 2015, he released Compton: A Soundtrack by Dr. Dre, a companion album to the N.W.A biopic Straight Outta Compton. The album featured guest appearances from Snoop Dogg, Kendrick Lamar, Ice Cube, Eminem, Xzibit, Anderson .Paak, and others. Dr Dre stated that Compton was inspired by his experiences growing up in the city and witnessing its transformation over the years. He also said that Compton was his final album, and that he had officially abandoned Detox. He explained that he did not feel comfortable releasing Detox because it did not meet his expectations.
 
However, some fans still hope that Detox might see the light of day someday. In 2021, producer Dem Jointz posted a photo on Instagram with the hashtag #Detox21, sparking rumors that Dr Dre might be working on the album again. In 2022, Dr Dre performed at the Super Bowl halftime show with Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Kendrick Lamar, Mary J. Blige, and N.W.A members Ice Cube and MC Ren. The performance was widely praised as one of the best in Super Bowl history, and it also reignited speculation that Dr Dre might have some new music in store for his fans. Whether or not Detox will ever be released remains a mystery, but one thing is certain: Dr Dre's legacy as one of the greatest producers and innovators in hip-hop is undeniable.
