<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Ensure that all variable font files have the same set of axes and axis ranges.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/varfont/consistent_axes](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/varfont/consistent_axes)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
In order to facilitate the construction of intuitive and friendly user
interfaces, all variable font files in a given family should have the same set
of variation axes. Also, each axis must have a consistent setting of min/max
value ranges accross all the files.</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** Urbanist-Italic[wght].ttf: lacks a 'ital' variation axis. [code: missing-axis]

* [com.google.fonts/check/meta/script_lang_tags](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/meta/script_lang_tags)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
The OpenType &#x27;meta&#x27; table originated at Apple. Microsoft added it to OT with
just two DataMap records:
- dlng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font is designed for
- slng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font supports
The slng structure is intended to describe which languages and scripts the font
overall supports. For example, a Traditional Chinese font that also contains
Latin characters, can indicate Hant,Latn, showing that it supports Hant, the
Traditional Chinese variant of the Hani script, and it also supports the Latn
script
The dlng structure is far more interesting. A font may contain various glyphs,
but only a particular subset of the glyphs may be truly &quot;leading&quot; in the design,
while other glyphs may have been included for technical reasons. Such a
Traditional Chinese font could only list Hant there, showing that it’s designed
for Traditional Chinese, but the font would omit Latn, because the developers
don’t think the font is really recommended for purely Latin-script use.
The tags used in the structures can comprise just script, or also language and
script. For example, if a font has Bulgarian Cyrillic alternates in the locl
feature for the cyrl BGR OT languagesystem, it could also indicate in dlng
explicitly that it supports bul-Cyrl. (Note that the scripts and languages in
meta use the ISO language and script codes, not the OpenType ones).
This check ensures that the font has the meta table containing the slng and dlng
structures.
All families in the Google Fonts collection should contain the &#x27;meta&#x27; table.
Windows 10 already uses it when deciding on which fonts to fall back to. The
Google Fonts API and also other environments could use the data for smarter
filtering. Most importantly, those entries should be added to the Noto fonts.
In the font making process, some environments store this data in external files
already. But the meta table provides a convenient way to store this inside the
font file, so some tools may add the data, and unrelated tools may read this
data. This makes the solution much more portable and universal.</pre>

<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Ensure VFs do not contain slnt or ital axes. </summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/varfont/unsupported_axes](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/varfont/unsupported_axes)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
The &#x27;ital&#x27; and &#x27;slnt&#x27; axes are not supported yet in Google Chrome.
For the time being, we need to ensure that VFs do not contain either of these
axes. Once browser support is better, we can deprecate this check.
